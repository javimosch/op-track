# Natural Language Aggregate Queries

## Overview

This document outlines the upcoming natural language feature for aggregate queries in the op-track project. The feature will allow users to input queries in natural language, which will then be translated into MongoDB aggregate queries using AI.

## Technical Specification

- Integration: We will use the Groq API with the Llama 3.1 70B model for natural language processing.
- Implementation: The feature will be integrated using the JavaScript API provided by Groq.

## Examples

Here are some examples of natural language queries and their corresponding MongoDB aggregate queries:

1. Natural Language: "Show me the average duration of operations for each project in the last month"
   MongoDB Aggregate Query:
   ```javascript
   [
     { $match: { date: { $gte: new Date(new Date().setMonth(new Date().getMonth() - 1)) } } },
     { $group: { _id: "$project", averageDuration: { $avg: "$duration" } } }
   ]
   ```

2. Natural Language: "List the top 5 longest running operations across all projects"
   MongoDB Aggregate Query:
   ```javascript
   [
     { $sort: { duration: -1 } },
     { $limit: 5 },
     { $project: { operation: 1, duration: 1, project: 1 } }
   ]
   ```

3. Natural Language: "Count the number of operations per day for the 'backend' project in the past week"
   MongoDB Aggregate Query:
   ```javascript
   [
     { $match: { 
         project: "backend", 
         date: { $gte: new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate() - 7)) } 
     } },
     { $group: { 
         _id: { $dateToString: { format: "%Y-%m-%d", date: "$date" } }, 
         count: { $sum: 1 } 
     } },
     { $sort: { _id: 1 } }
   ]
   ```

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up Groq API integration in the project.
2. Create a new endpoint for natural language queries.
3. Implement the translation logic using the Llama 3.1 70B model.
4. Add error handling and validation for natural language inputs.
5. Update the frontend to include an option for natural language queries.
6. Add examples and documentation for users on how to formulate natural language queries.

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to improve accuracy.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report inaccurate translations.
- Expand the range of supported query types and complexity.
